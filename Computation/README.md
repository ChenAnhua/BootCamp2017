# OSM Lab: Computational Methods Section Materials

This directory in the repository contains all the materials for the computational methods section of the OSM Lab Boot Camp.


## Schedule

The computational methods lab sessions for the OSM Lab will be held from 8:00-11:50am, Tuesday and Thursday in Saieh Hall, Room 247. The lab files in the schedule under the "Materials column" that start with "ACME" come from the Brigham Young University Math Department's [Applied and Computational Math Emphasis (ACME program)](http://www.acme.byu.edu/). These computational labs are open source. We cover only a subset of these excellent applied math Python labs, which are available in their entirety at [http://www.acme.byu.edu/2016-2017-materials/](http://www.acme.byu.edu/2016-2017-materials/). We highly recommend that you take time after the Boot Camp to work through some of the other labs that are available to you.
